OnGoing:
	OBS/Xsplit Testing for Chroma keys/Responsiveness
	Dejunking of primary Functions (Remove any un-needed calls/interactions)
	General Optimizations -> Better variable Naming, Better control flows, Early Escapes

Bug Fix:
	Rewrite Set Keybind to check Translations for modifier keys
	- Needs More Testing. 

Features:
	Support for Pictures/Bitmaps?
	Make project not look like a generic WinForm App
	Different ways to view input
	Auto Crop Define:
		Shows the Left:Right:Top:Bottom pixels to object to be captured for easy setup
		ex:			30:30:150:120 (Line up order with OBS order)

	Custom Fonts?


BackEnd:
	User warning pop up when program is started with a "never show again" option
	-Currently missing "Never show again" option

	Get a better name for Translations 
	-More accurate name
	Create a better project name (Make it a pun or something!)

Shelved:
	Rebuild TranslationsDict to an extension of Dictionary instead of a shell class
	-Requires <T,T> keypair but I need to enforce the current keypair typing.
	Optimize Structures and class objects (Unsure if able to ?)
	-Early Optimization currently
	Ghost mode version of the project? (only outputs to file unless pause bind is pressed) 
	-Seperate Product idea
In Testing:
	NONE D:
