NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION - Implement CheckBox for Translation + form/section to add/change/remove Translations
ONGOING - Test With OBS/XSplit? (Might need to look into other streaming programs)
- Chroma key functions weirdly, Added user defined color to make it easier

Features:
	Ability to select type of user output (Currently Textbox/Listbox)
	Implement Translation modifications as end user
	StreamView Window:
		ONGOING - TextBox User output
		DONE - Add ability to change text color.
	Support for Pictures/Bitmaps?
	Make project not look like a generic WinForm App...

	Ghost mode version of the project? (only outputs to file unless pause bind is pressed) (VERY LIKELY NOT DUE TO BEING A FULL ON KEYLOGGER)
	
BackEnd:
	Get Unicode Characters for :
		Shift,
		Escape,
		Delete,
		Enter,
		Backspace,
		Ctrl,
		Alt,
		Home (Windows button)
	And implement as Translations (Optional?)
	Get a better name for Translations (More accurate)
	Create a better project name (Make it a pun or something!)
	
	Dejunking of primary Functions (Remove any un-needed calls/interactions)
	General Optimizations -> Better variable Naming, Better control flows, Early Escapes

	Optimize Structures and classes objects (Unsure if able to ?)
	Rebuild TranslationsDict to an extension of Dictionary instead of a shell class?

	Quick Launch (Skips showing Main Setup form and instantly loads user settings and opens StreamView)

	LoggingHook:
		DONE - Implement TOFILE System
		AWAITING GUI implementation - Toggle for TOFILE
		NOT STARTED - Toggle to purge TOFILE file on program startup AND/OR close (incase people dont want data lingering)
