OnGoing:
	OBS/Xsplit Testing for Chroma keys/Responsiveness


Features:
	Support for Pictures/Bitmaps?
	Make project not look like a generic WinForm App...
	Ghost mode version of the project? (only outputs to file unless pause bind is pressed) (VERY LIKELY NOT DUE TO BEING A FULL ON KEYLOGGER)
	Different ways to view input


BackEnd:
	Override outputting "Shift" with outputting the upper case version of what is clicked (might require a dict/list of shared keys ex: 1 => !)

	User warning about the Nature of the program? (pop up when program is started with a "never show again" option)

	Get Unicode/UTF-16 Characters for :
		Shift,     (U+21E7) (⇧)
		Escape,    (U+238B) (⎋)
		Delete,    (U+2326) (⌦)
		Enter,     (¶)  ()
		Backspace, (U+232B) (⌫)
		Ctrl,      (⎈)
		Alt,       (⎇)
		Home (Windows button) (⌂)
	And implement as Default Translations
	
	Get a better name for Translations (More accurate)
	Create a better project name (Make it a pun or something!)
	
	Dejunking of primary Functions (Remove any un-needed calls/interactions)
	General Optimizations -> Better variable Naming, Better control flows, Early Escapes

	Optimize Structures and class objects (Unsure if able to ?)
	Rebuild TranslationsDict to an extension of Dictionary instead of a shell class?
