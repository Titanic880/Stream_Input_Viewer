Welcome to Stream Input Viewer! (new name TBD...)

This program will allow you to display all (if not most) keyboard inputs on a stream/recording.
Any time you adjust a setting it is automatically saved and all settings are saved on program exit.
To have your inputs shown on the stream view you need to add them to the List of tracked programs,
otherwise it will be ignored!
If you want to change the output of a given key;
you are able to using the Translation options on the right of the Setup View.

Using the Toggle buttons you are able to enable/disable Logging functionalities and shortcuts!
Using the Color buttons allows you to alter the background and text colors that will be shown on the StreamView form
(Respective buttons will preview the color you have selected!)

To set your pause keybind, just click the key + modifiers you want 
(Currently does not support multiple main keys and only modifiers ex: Shift/Alt/Ctrl)
then Click the 'Set Pause Keybind' button to save it.

You are required to have at minimum:
1 tracked program 
Pause Keybind

Prior to being able to start the stream view.
